# Analysis-of-satellite-images

Hi! This is my scientific work that I wrote back in school. The topic of this project is "Analysis of satellite images for flood forecasting". 
Here I implemented a Python script that allows you to calculate the amount of water on the ground from satellite images. In the future, 
by comparing these indicators, it is possible to obtain statistical data on which to determine at what time of the year, 
the greatest flooding of territories occurs, which would allow timely measures to be taken to prevent destruction.
